# Mc-Dashboard
Minecraft server hosts always seem to have custom Dashboards, but nobody ever seem to know how they are made.
Made in Express.js and socket.io i plan to add more feutures and make it a fully flashed Dashboard with Vue.js as the ui

- create a folder named: "minecraft"

- insert minecraft server files into "minecraft" folder

- run: "npm install"

- run "npm run start"
